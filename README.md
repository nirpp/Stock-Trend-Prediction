# Stock-Trend-Prediction
Created a Stock Trend Prediction Web Application in Python. 
Used Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science, It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.

I have used LSTM model (Long Short Term Memory). This is a model that has been trained on historical data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The data set comprises of all data records,This model aims to pick up key trends in the stock price fluctuations based on Time Series mapping. It is able to render predictions for the upcoming time period. The accuracy as obtained on the training data-set is about 90 percent and it successfully demonstrates key trends.
